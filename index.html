  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
  <p>The place I am most interested in IT is that I can write a web page or program by myself and add details according to my preferences, which is very fulfilling. I had this idea when I first came into contact with computer games when I was in primary school. The official website and client of the game at that time were not as user-friendly as they are now, and it was not smooth to use, so I wanted to improve it at that time. I chose RMIT because I heard that the IT here is very amazing, and Melbourne is a beautiful coastal city like my hometown, the climate is relatively close, so I came. I hope to learn more about IT basics in the following studies, such as various programming languages ​​and basic IT business, so that my work after graduation will be smoother.</p>
